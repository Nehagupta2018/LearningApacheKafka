Broker is a server.
Cluster is composed multiple machines(server).
Each broker is identified by its number(integer).
Each broker contains certain topic partitions.

Partitions have replication factors which. should be greater than 1 so that other brokers can save the data. Even if one broker is lost other brokers can serve the ddata.
At one time only ONE broker can be a leader for a given partition.
Only that leader can receive ans serve the data. Others will synchronize the data.
Thus each partition will have one leader and multiple ISR(in-sync-replicas)

Producers write data to topics.
Producers automatically know to which broker and partitions to write.
Producers will recover automatically in case of broker failures.
Producers can choose to receive acknowledgement of data written:
acks=0       No acknowledgement
acks=1       Leader acknowledge
acks = all   Leader+replicas acknowledge

Producers can choose to send a key with the message.
Same key will always go to same partition.

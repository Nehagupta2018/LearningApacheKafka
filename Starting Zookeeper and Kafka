Create a directory called data in kafka folder and then create two separate directories inside it 
1. zookeeper
2. kafka

Update the created zookeeper folder path in config/zookeeper.properties file and restart zookeeper using the command
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Open one more terminal window and do the same for kafka folder path. Update that path in config/server.properties. file.
Start kafka by the command
bin/kafak-server-start.sh config/server.properties.

So now you will have zookeeper running in one window and kafka running in the other.

Topics -- particular stream of data (similar to database tables), defined by its name.
Partitions -- Topics are split into partitions and each partition is ordered.
Offset -- Each message within a partition gets an incremental id called offset.

To understand it in real time, leta take an example of truck company using kafka:

Truck1, Truck2, Truck3........................................................................Truckn

                   All sending messages to kafka topic (Message has truckID and truckGPS location)
                   
                   
                                    Kafka (Truck-gps topic)


                      Consumer1           Consumer2           Consumer3
                      
 Here Consumers can be mobile app, notification app or even more.
 Consumers are partitions.
 Offsets are the messages ID received by consumers.
 
 Offsets only have a meaning for a specific partition. Order is guranteed within a partition not across partitions.
 Data is kept for a limited time (default is one week)
 Data written is immutable.
 Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is  provided.

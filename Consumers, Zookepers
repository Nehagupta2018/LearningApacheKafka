Consumers read data from a topic.
Consumers know which broker to read from
Data is read in order within each partitions.

Consumer is basically like a java application.
Consumer groups consists of consumers.
If you have more consumers than partitions then some consumers will be inactive.


Consumer Offsets:
The offsets committed live in kafka topic named _consumer_offsets
If a consumer dies, it will be able to read back from where it left ogg thanks to the committed consumer topics.


Every kafka broker is called a bootstrap server.
You only need to connect to one broker and you will be connected to the entire cluster.


Zookeepers hold the brokers together.
Zookeeper helps in performing leader election for partitions.
Zookeeper sends notofications to kafka in case of chnanges. So Kafka cannot work without Zookeepers.
Zookeeper operates with an odd number of servers(3,5,7...)
Zookeeper has a leader and the rest are followers.
